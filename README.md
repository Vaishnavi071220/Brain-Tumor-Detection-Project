# Brain-Tumor-Detection-Project

Over the past seven months, As a lab research assistant I have delved deep into brain tumor analysis, exploring cutting-edge deep learning, hybrid models, and LLMs. This journey has been both challenging and rewarding, allowing me to develop, experiment, and refine multiple AI-driven approaches for tumor detection, segmentation, and localization.
> Developed a deep learning pipeline using CNN Xception, achieving an impressive 98% accuracy for tumor classification.
> Integrated ML classifiers (SVM, RF, DT, KNN, LR) after deep feature extraction, yielding high accuracy:

SVM â€“ 94.29%
DT â€“ 77.14%
KNN â€“ 91.43%
RF â€“ 97.43%
LR â€“ 97.14%

>Cross-validation on datasets: Trained my model on a custom dataset and rigorously tested it on the Br35H standard dataset that has 3060 brain MRI images to ensure robustness and generalization.
> Experimented with multiple architectures, including VGG16, EfficientNet variants, InceptionV3, MobileNetV3, SqueezeNet, and ResNet50, as well as ensemble models.
> Explored image enhancement techniques like Histogram Equalization, CLAHE, and hybrid networks, incorporating ViTs for performance improvement.
> Implemented diverse augmentation techniques to enhance generalizability and model robustness.
> Optimization techniques such as fine-tuning, dropout regularization, and adaptive learning rates for improved model generalization.
> Conducted extensive evaluations on accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, IoU, Confidence matrix, Confusion matrix and AUC-ROC curves, ensuring a data-driven approach to model selection.
> Implemented Grad-CAM and SHAP visualizations to better understand model decisions and improve trust in AI-based medical diagnostics.
>  I explored the theoretical foundations of CNN architectures, feature engineering, transfer learning, and ensemble methods, ensuring a well-rounded analysis of different AI approaches.

This project has been a transformative learning experience, strengthening my expertise in NLP, deep learning hybrid AI models, and large language models (LLMs). Excited to keep pushing the boundaries of AI in biomedical research! ðŸ’¡

Would love to connect with professionals and researchers working on similar challenges! Letâ€™s innovate together.
